PENTAGRAM - a game where magic is trap-based
Form pentagrams and other shapes by placing down runes in specific arrangements!
Activate them to launch spells at the enemies.

Current controls and features:
Use arrow keys to move.
Press 't' to place a rune down.
Complete a shape by pressing 't' at the first rune of the shape to form the last line.
Once a shape is completed, you may place more runes to make more shapes.
Press the spacebar to activate all runes on the map.

Damage varies based on the complexity of the shape and how regular the shape is (difference between line lengths and angles).
A maximum of 10 runes may be placed at a time.

Future features:
Multiple sets of runes for multiple pentagrams.
Pentagrams will be summons-based, summoning different creatures for different effects.
The type of rune will have great effect on what kind of summon you get.
Beware: If your pentagram is too misshapen, your spell may backfire!
Summoned creatures may cast spells varying from explosions to stuns to heals, or fight alongside you.
